# [Minotaur](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.modrinth.minotaur)
A Gradle plugin for uploading build artifacts directly to Modrinth.

## Usage Guide
To use this plugin you must add it to your build script. This can be done using the plugins DSL or added to the classpath directly for legacy scripts.

**Plugin DSL**    
```gradle
plugins {
    id "com.modrinth.minotaur" version "1.1.0"
}
```

**Legacy**
```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath group: 'gradle.plugin.com.modrinth.minotaur', name: 'Minotaur', version: '1.1.0'
    }
}
```

The next step is to create a new task for uploading to Modrinth. This task allows you to configure the upload and control when and how versions are uploaded.

```groovy
import com.modrinth.minotaur.TaskModrinthUpload

task publishModrinth (type: TaskModrinthUpload){

    token = 'secret' // Use an environment property!
    projectId = 'ssUbhMkL'
    versionNumber = '1.0.0'
    // This is the java jar task
    uploadFile = jar       // <-- use this for Forge
    uploadFile = remapJar  // <-- use this for Fabric
    addGameVersion('1.16.2')
    addLoader('fabric')
}
```

## Development Information
This section contains information useful to those working on the plugin directly or creating their own custom versions of our plugin. If you want to just use Minotaur in your build pipeline you will not need to know or understand any of this.

### Local Usage
If you want to use the plugin from your local maven repo make sure you have added the mavenLocal repository to your script. Grabbing the plugin is the same as normal. To publish locally you run `./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal`. Local maven files can be found in the `%home%/.m2/` directory.

### Direct File Usage
In some cases you may want to use the JAR file directly in your script rather than pulling from a repository. This is generally not recommended but may be unavoidable in some circumstances. If you do this make sure you add all of our dependencies to your classpath. Using the file directly will not use our pom file and will not pull these dependencies in for you.

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath files { file('../../../../build/libs').listFiles()}
        classpath group: 'org.apache.httpcomponents', name: 'httpmime', version: '4.5.2'
        classpath group: 'org.apache.httpcomponents', name: 'httpclient', version: '4.5.2'
        classpath group: 'com.google.code.gson', name: 'gson', version: '2.6.2'
    }
}
```
